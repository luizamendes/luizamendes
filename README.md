### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Luiza Mendes**. I am from **Brazil**. I am a **Graphic Designer** and soon to be a **Software Engineer**. I worked as a Graphic Designer for nearly six years. In 2017, I decided to go back to the university to learn more about the development world, that dazzles me so much.

As a Designer, nothing better than starting my tech career as a Frontend Developer, as I have been working since 2018. That said, my specialties in the field are **Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, along with React Hooks, Redux, and Redux-saga. I also have experience in Node.**

I love learning. I have been working on my development skills every day:

- Whether it is at the university, where I get to study different technologies, like: **Java, .Net, Python and Artificial Intelligence**
- Or devoting myself to improve my coding skills, learning more about the technologies I work with.

I am currently studying/working on:

- Advanced algorithms
- Data structures
- Solving challenges on Hackerrank.

In my free time, I enjoy watching TV series and movies, playing games, enjoying good music and traveling!
