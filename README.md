### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Luiza Mendes**. I am from **Brazil**. I am a **Graphic Designer** and a **Software Engineer**. I worked as a Graphic Designer for nearly six years. In 2017, I decided to go back to the university to learn more about the development world, that dazzles me so much.

As a Designer, I fell in love with the front end universe. That said, my specialties in the field are **Javascript, HTML, CSS, React (Hooks), Nextjs, Vue. I also have experience in Node.**

I love learning and I always dedicate myself to discover other technologies, improve my coding and problem solving skills. 

In my free time, I enjoy watching TV series and movies, playing games, enjoying good music and traveling!

I speak **Portuguese** as my native language, **English**, **French** and **Spanish**.
